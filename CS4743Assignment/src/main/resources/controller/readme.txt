# CS4743 Assignments
The assignment is a JavaFX Application that allows the user to
see a list of books and see details about each, adding and removing books
from its inventory on the database as desired. Users are also able to update
and details about each book. Meant to be a practice
on the proper creation of an enterprise-tier application.

Because JavaFX is no longer included with JDK12, project currently using jdk1.8 and 
seems to work fine, locally.
