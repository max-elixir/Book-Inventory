# CS4743 Assignments
The assignment is a JavaFX Application that allows the user to
see a list of books and see details about each. Meant to be a practice
on proper usage of an object-oriented system.

Because JavaFX wasn't included with JDK12, there was alot of jumping around
between JDK12, 1.8, and 1.5. Project currently using jdk1.8 and 
seems to work fine, locally.
